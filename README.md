# Project-2
ETL project for NU data analytics bootcamp

## Project Proposal
Use the data sets below to create a database that allows users to identify hospital and providers in the US. The eventual goal of this relational database is to be used as an interface for users to access providers close to home and compare costs of hospital stays by DRG (Diagnosis Related Grouping). The database will provide information on:

* Hospitals in your area
* Providers in your area
* Cost/Payment (Medicare) by DRG
* Hospital volume trends
