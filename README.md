# Project-2
ETL project for NU data analytics bootcamp

## Project Proposal
Use the data sets below to create a database that allows users to identify healthcare procedure trends in the US. The eventual goal of this relational database is to be used as an interface for users to access and compare costs of procedures at different locations to make budget-savvy and informed decisions. The database will provide information on:

* Average cost of surgery in the US
* Cost variation by region
* Surgery volume trends
* Provider/Hospital volume trends
